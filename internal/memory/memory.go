// Package memory is a durable, scoped note store that survives a session.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR. A session ends and everything it worked out goes with it —
// the convention this repo actually follows, the decision behind a strange-
// looking guard, the finding an audit already confirmed. AGENTS.md holds what
// someone sat down and wrote; this holds what accumulates, and it is scoped so
// the two do not become one file nobody prunes.
//
// NOT A SECOND PLAN STORE. The "no new store" invariant is about PLAN STATE —
// "plan state is session events", ARCHITECTURE.md — because two stores for one
// fact eventually disagree. Notes are not derivable from any event log, so there
// is nothing here for a second store to contradict.
//
// THE SAFETY RULES ARE PLAN_STORE'S, deliberately reused rather than rewritten:
// an allow-list name that cannot spell a traversal component, containment of
// every operation to a handle on the workspace (internal/pathjail), and an
// O_EXCL temp file renamed into place. A note store is a write primitive pointed
// at a path the model chooses, which is the same shape as "save my plan" and
// needs the same answers.
