// apply on this model?":
//
//	door 1  select the profile while already on the model  (handleProfileCommand)
//	door 2  switch to the model with the profile active    (reconcileProfileAfterModelSwitch)
//
// Each door already had tests. Both passed. They disagreed anyway, because each
// asserted its OWN expectation and nothing compared them: door 1 was fixed to
// stop treating an uncatalogued model's empty ring as a refusal, and door 2 was
// left calling the old predicate. The result was that the same user on the same
// model got a different effort depending on which door they came through.
//
// This test asserts the doors against EACH OTHER, so a future change to one of
// them fails here rather than shipping a second disagreement.
