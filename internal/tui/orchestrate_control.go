// Per-plan control: stop, pause and resume the PLAN without stopping the TURN.
//
// Before this, abandoning a twenty-task plan meant Ctrl-C, which cancels the
// whole run and takes the conversation with it. The two are different
// intentions and now have different acts.
//
// WHY A SLASH COMMAND rather than the reference's bare p/x/r keys. Bare letters
// go to the composer here, and almost every ctrl chord is already bound —
// ctrl+g alone had to dodge ctrl+o (detailed transcript) and ctrl+p (the
// update_plan panel). More importantly, only commandPrompt is queued while a
// run is pending; a slash command is dispatched immediately, which is the whole
// requirement for "stop the plan that is running right now".
//
// NOT BUILT, with reasons, both from the same gap-report item:
//
//   - RESTART. Re-running a plan means re-issuing the tool call with the same
//     arguments, and nothing stores them — the panel holds a rendering of the
//     plan, not the plan. That is the persistence seam named plans (§5.7) is
//     for, and faking it from the panel's copy would produce a plan that only
//     resembles the one that ran.
//   - FILTER. A 50-task plan needs SCROLLING, which is the row cap, not a
//     predicate. Filtering a list the user cannot see all of solves the second
//     problem first.
