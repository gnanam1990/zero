// THE ADDITIVITY PROOF.
//
// ZeroMaxing Phase 2 adds an `orchestrate` tool. The constraint proved here is
// that REGISTERING THAT TOOL changes nothing while the posture is OFF: same
// advertised tool set, same tool-definition bytes, same assembled system
// prompt, therefore the same token count and the same provider request.
//
// Stated narrowly on purpose. "With the posture off, Zero is byte-identical to
// a build without the feature" is the tempting phrasing and it is not true:
// system_prompt.go drops the ~5 KB confirmation policy for any run that cannot
// mutate, and runCanMutate is evaluated regardless of posture. An all-read-only
// run — `zero exec --enabled-tools read_file,grep`, or a read-only specialist
// child — therefore gets a smaller prompt than a build without the feature,
// posture off. That drop is deliberate and fails closed; it is simply not part
// of what this test proves, and the comparison below could not catch it anyway
// since both registries take the same branch.
//
// The proof is a CONTROLLED COMPARISON rather than a frozen hash of the whole
// prefix. Two registries are built that differ in exactly one thing — whether
// the orchestrate tool is registered — and the posture-off output of both must
// be byte-identical. That states the real property ("registering this tool
// changes nothing while the posture is off"), it exercises the Deferred()
// mechanism that enforces it, and it cannot rot: there is no constant to
// regenerate and nothing to keep in step by hand.
//
// A frozen whole-prefix hash was tried first and is the wrong instrument here:
// the assembled prompt embeds the working directory and the operating system,
// so the constant would be machine- and platform-specific and every CI runner
// would "fail" honestly-unchanged code. The definition-bytes hash below keeps
// the frozen-golden idea where it IS portable.

// fixtureCwd is a fixed synthetic path. The prompt embeds the working
// directory, so a real t.TempDir() would make any hash unstable across runs.
const fixtureCwd = "/zero/fixture/workspace"

// baseFixtureRegistry is the control: a fixed, representative tool set with NO
// orchestrate tool. Deliberately not the full core set — that would make the
// golden hash churn on every unrelated tool change and train the reader to
// regenerate it.
