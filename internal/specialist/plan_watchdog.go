// The per-task stall watchdog.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS NOW. The plan's token budget became optional and unbounded by
// default, because it never bounded anything: it was checked only between
// tasks, so a six-task chain asking for 200k spent 469,555. That left
// max_wall_seconds — also optional, also model-supplied — as the only bound on
// a plan, and nothing at all bounding a SINGLE task. A child that wedges
// against an unresponsive provider hangs until the user notices.
//
// KEYED ON SILENCE, NOT DURATION. A task legitimately reading forty files for
// four minutes is working; a task that has emitted nothing for three is not.
// Killing the first would be worse than not having a watchdog — a timeout that
// fires on healthy work teaches users to raise it until it never fires. So the
// clock resets on every stream event the child emits, and only silence counts.
//
// THE RETRY POLICY, which this file previously said needed its own argument.
// Here it is.
//
// ONLY A STALL IS RETRIED. Every other failure is left exactly as it was: a
// task whose child ran and reported an error produced a real answer, and running
// it again spends another task's budget to receive the same one. A stall is the
// opposite — it is the ABSENCE of an answer, so there is no result to disbelieve
// and nothing partial to lose. That asymmetry is the whole justification, and it
// is why the retry is keyed on the watchdog's own verdict rather than on "the
// task failed".
//
// THE DEFAULT IS ONE EXTRA ATTEMPT, and that is a judgment, not a measurement.
// It costs a wedged task twice the stall timeout before the plan moves on — six
// minutes at the default — in exchange for surviving a transient provider or
// network condition without losing the task's dependents too. Under a posture
// whose entire premise is spending more for a better answer, six minutes of
// patience is the cheaper mistake. A caller who disagrees sets max_retries to 0,
// which is why an explicit 0 has to be distinguishable from an absent key.
//
// A CANCELLED TASK IS NEVER RETRIED. The user stopping a plan and a provider
// going quiet both surface as a context error; retrying the first would mean
// Ctrl-C launching another child.

// defaultStallTimeout is how long a task may emit nothing before it is
// considered wedged. Deliberately generous: a slow model on a large file can be
// quiet for a long time, and a false positive here costs real work.
const defaultStallTimeout = 3 * time.Minute

// minStallTimeout floors a caller-supplied value. Below this the watchdog would
// fire on ordinary think-time and become a random task-killer.
const minStallTimeout = 30 * time.Second
