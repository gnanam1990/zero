// AN ISOLATED PLAN TASK MUST NOT BE HANDED THE PARENT'S TREE BACK.
//
// The worktree exists so a write-capable plan has "somewhere to write that is
// not the user's tree" (plan_worktree.go) — one branch, one diff, a discard
// path. --cwd narrows the child to it. If the parent's own workspace root then
// arrives as --add-dir, the very next flag re-opens everything the worktree was
// protecting, and the isolation is decoration.
//
// This is not hypothetical. In a measured run the task's cwd was the worktree
// and ten writes landed in /Users/kratos/mini, each allowed with the reason
// "workspace write is allowed" — because by then it genuinely was inside the
// child's write roots.
