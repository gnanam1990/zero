// THE CLAIMS NOBODY RE-DERIVES.
//
// A plan fans out, every task reports, and the report carries what they said.
// Under zeromaxing that is five or more sub-agents' worth of claims, each
// written by a model that cannot see the others' work and will never be asked
// about it again. The bundled `research` plan ends in a refute step for exactly
// this reason, and the evidence rules in planTaskSystemPrompt exist to make one
// possible — but both are habits. A plan whose author forgot to add a verifier
// finished green with nothing checked, and a wrong "looks fine" is
// indistinguishable from a right one once it reaches the report.
//
// So under the posture, a multi-task plan that names no verification gets one
// appended: a read-only task depending on every other, told to REFUTE rather
// than to agree.
//
// FIVE THINGS IT MUST NOT DO, each of which is why a condition below exists:
//
//   - Refuse a plan the author wrote. The size tier caps TASK COUNT, so
//     appending to a plan already at its ceiling would turn a valid plan into a
//     rejected one — for a task the author never wrote. No headroom, no append.
//   - Change what the plan may touch. The appended task names NO tools, which
//     planToolGrant resolves to the read-only intersection of the parent's
//     grant. A named write tool would flip RequiresIsolation for the WHOLE plan
//     (isolation is plan-level), moving every other task into a worktree — the
//     measured failure plan_workspace_reach.go exists to catch.
//   - Second-guess a plan that already verifies. classifyTaskRole is the same
//     classifier the model router uses; if any task already reads as verify,
//     this does nothing.
//   - Collide with an author's id. The id is probed against the plan's own ids
//     and suffixed until free.
//   - Appear from nowhere. Every append returns a note, which the tool prints
//     with its assignment notes, so a task in the report that nobody wrote is
//     explained where it happens.

// IT IS TOLD TO REFUTE, and to default to refuted when uncertain, because a
// verifier that sets out to agree always does — the same reasoning the bundled
// research plan's refute step carries, and the reason that plan ships at all.

// above it may have read, measured or changed things, and the check that
