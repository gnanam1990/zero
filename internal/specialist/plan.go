// ZeroMaxing plan capture: a validated dependency graph, executed CONCURRENTLY.
//
// A plan declares a dependency graph and the executor runs it in topological
// order, up to budget.max_workers tasks at a time (maxPlanWorkers = 16). Tasks
// may be granted write tools by name, in which case the plan runs in an isolated
// git worktree — see RequiresIsolation and resolvePlanWorkspace.
//
// THE MEASUREMENT SURVIVED THE GATE IT WAS BUILT FOR. This header used to read
// "executed SEQUENTIALLY … one task at a time … if the recorded max_speedup says
// fan-out would not have paid for itself, Phase 3 is not built". That was a
// genuine evidence gate, and it was PASSED: a five-task diamond measured 40.0s
// at one worker against 27.0s at four (4643666), so concurrency was built —
// the gate did its job and opened. PlanReport.MaxSpeedup is still
// recorded and still reported — the number that justified fan-out is the same
// number that now says whether any given plan was worth fanning out — but it is
// no longer deciding whether to build it.
//
// Fan-out, pipeline and phase are ONE structure: fan-out is tasks with no
// dependencies, a pipeline is a chain, a phase is a label plus a barrier. The
// prototype grew five separate hooks for these and never invoked any of them.

// Plan is a validated, executable plan.
//
// Its fields are UNEXPORTED and ParsePlan is the only constructor. That is not
// stylistic: it makes skipping validation impossible rather than merely wrong.
// The prototype's validator was reachable, correct, and never called from the
// production path; a type that cannot be constructed any other way removes the

	// TWO REASONS, and the second was measured rather than reasoned.

	// It is not read-only. It REPLACES the parent's whole plan list on every

	// task is an investigator that reports to the parent, which owns the list.
	// Nothing about the job needs it.
	//
	// And it was the single reason a plan child carried the confirmation
	// policy. update_plan declares readOnlySafety but sets no capabilities, so
	// CapabilitiesOf reports EffectUnknown — the fail-closed default — while its
	// safety says read-only. runCanMutate reads the CAPABILITY, so one
	// unclassified tool in an otherwise read-only grant made the whole child
	// look mutating, and ~2,500 tokens of policy it can never need rode along on
	// every task of every plan.

	// parallel execution it is not safe for. Removing it from this grant fixes
	// the plan path without touching a classification that means something else
