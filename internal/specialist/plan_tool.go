//
// It is DEFERRED unless the zeromaxing posture is active. That is the whole
// mechanism behind Phase 2's overriding constraint: with the posture off the
// tool is registered but never advertised, so the advertised tool set, the
// tool-definition bytes and the assembled prompt are byte-identical to a build
// without the feature (proved by
// TestPostureOffPrefixUnchangedByRegisteringTheTool in internal/agent).
//
// Phase 2 is read-only and sequential by construction, not by convention: plan
// tasks may not request mutating tools, and Budget.MaxWorkers must be 1. Both
// are rejected at parse time rather than coerced, so the fields stay meaningful
// for a later phase instead of quietly lying.

The machine's own capacity may be lower and the report says which number applied. max_tokens and max_wall_seconds are optional bounds; omit them to run unbounded — spend is reported either way. max_stall_seconds bounds how long ONE task may emit nothing (default 180); it resets on every event, so a slow-but-working task is never stopped. max_retries (0-3, default 1) is how many extra attempts a STALLED task gets; a task that failed with a real error is never retried. max_tokens_per_task bounds what ONE task may spend, and is the right knob for budgeting per sub-agent — use it ALONE, without max_tokens, or each task is limited by its share of the total instead and the plan is refused as incoherent. Sizing, from measured runs: a task that traces or audits a large repo costs 510k-1,017k tokens, so budget about 1M each; one reasoning over what its dependencies already found costs far less. max_tokens is the TOTAL across every task, not per task — max_tokens_per_task is the per-task one, and it may not exceed the total. A cap BELOW what a task needs saves nothing — a plan capping tasks at 200k lost all six of them between 213k and 259k and still spent 1,437,049 tokens, finishing none. A capped task is told its budget and asked to write a partial answer before reaching it, so tight is survivable and too-tight is not. Omit max_tokens unless the user asked for a spending limit: guessing it low is how a plan spends everything and returns nothing. A budget far below what its task count needs is warned about at admission and left to you. When a plan runs out, tasks in flight are STOPPED MID-RUN — they keep what they had already found, and it reaches both the report and any task depending on them — while tasks not yet started never run at all. So the cost of guessing low is the questions at the END of the plan, which is usually the synthesis you wanted. If you cannot estimate, omit max_tokens and use max_wall_seconds instead.",
