// A plan that isolated into a tree its own tasks cannot read.
//
// THE MEASURED FAILURE. A six-task research plan was started from a directory
// that happened to be a git repo with ONE tracked file. Five tasks asked for
// read_file/grep/glob; the sixth also asked for exec_command, which is not in
// planReadOnlyTools — so RequiresIsolation flipped for the WHOLE plan and every
// task was moved into a worktree containing that one file. The tasks had been
// pointed at absolute paths in a different tree, which was now outside their
// sandbox, and three of them died reporting "I cannot". About 143,000 tokens,
// and the sixth task succeeded only because asking for exec_command had raised
// its autonomy far enough to read back out.
//
// Isolation itself is right: write tasks belong in a worktree. What was missing
// is that nothing checked the worktree could serve the plan before dispatching
// six tasks into it. resolvePlanWorkspace already refuses when isolation is
// UNAVAILABLE; this refuses when it is available and useless.
//
// FAILS TOWARD RUNNING THE PLAN. A false refusal blocks work that would have
// succeeded, so this only fires on evidence that cannot be a guess: an absolute
// path, written in a task's own prompt, that EXISTS on disk, and that is outside
// the workspace the task will run in. All three, or nothing happens. A path that
// does not exist is somebody else's error; a relative path resolves against the
// workspace and is not this function's business; a plan that never isolated
// keeps the parent's tree and cannot have this problem at all.

// absolutePathPattern finds POSIX-style absolute paths in prose.
//
// Deliberately loose, because the EXISTENCE check below is what makes a match
// meaningful. It will happily match "/settings" out of a URL and "/v1/pay" out
// of a sentence; neither exists on disk, so neither survives.

// THE SECOND SHAPE OF THE SAME FAILURE, and the one the absolute-path check
// above misses entirely.
//
// A later run of the same plan named its targets RELATIVELY — "internal/
// specialist/", "internal/swarm/" — plus a commit sha. Not one absolute path
// anywhere, so unreachablePlanPaths found nothing and six tasks were dispatched
// into a worktree holding a single file. The child said it plainly: "no Go files
// anywhere in the workspace… the only reachable commit is 3177684c".
//
// A relative path is far weaker evidence than an absolute one: prose is full of
// slash-shaped things, and a path that does not exist yet is exactly what a
// scaffolding task is for. So this fires only on a CONJUNCTION that a working
// plan cannot satisfy:
//
//   - the plan isolated, and
//   - it names at least two path-shaped tokens, and
//   - NOT ONE of them exists in the workspace, and
//   - the workspace is bare.
//
// A plan genuinely about its own tree resolves at least one token. A scaffolding
// plan creating new files runs in a worktree of a real repo, which is not bare.
// Both conditions have to be wrong at once, which is what the measured failure
// looked like and what an ordinary run does not.

// relativePathPattern matches path-shaped tokens.
//
// DELIBERATELY NARROWER THAN "has a slash", because "and/or", "read/write" and
// "input/output" are not paths and appear in prompts constantly. A token
// qualifies only if it ends in a slash, carries a file extension, or has three
// or more segments — which those three do not.
