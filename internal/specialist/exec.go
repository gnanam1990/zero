	// A CHILD GETTING LESS THAN ITS PARENT IS ALSO A BUG, and it produced a real
	// one: a run was granted ~/zm-lab mid-session, created it, copied packages
	// into it, then dispatched plan tasks to read them. Every task was refused
	// — "the target directory is outside the workspace boundary" — because a
	// child rebuilds its sandbox from --cwd alone and the grant lived only in
	// the parent's engine. Two tasks died, two dependents were skipped, and a
	// whole retry plan was spent rediscovering the boundary.
	//
	// A FUNCTION, not a slice, because the answer changes DURING the run: a
	// request_permissions grant lands mid-session, and a value captured at
	// wiring time would carry the roots the run started with forever — which is
	// precisely the staleness that made plan model discovery probe the wrong

// applyTaskModel sets a per-Task model on the manifest it will run under.
//
// A MANIFEST MODEL OVERRIDES THE PARENT'S — resolvedChildModel prefers it — so
// setting it here is all it takes for a standalone Task to run on a different
// model. An empty request changes nothing, keeping every existing spawn on the
// inherited model exactly as before.
//
// AND IT FORWARDS THE PARENT'S EFFORT. appendModelArgs inherits the parent's
// reasoning effort ONLY when no model is named, so naming a model would
// otherwise drop the zeromaxing posture's raised effort. Setting the effort
// explicitly here keeps it — the child re-clamps against the named model, so
// forwarding a tier it does not support is safe. A manifest that already names
// its own effort is left alone.
// autoTaskModel picks a per-role model for a Task that named none, but only
// under the zeromaxing posture with auto-assignment configured.
//
// It reuses the plan path's own classifier and role pins, so a delegated
// sub-agent is routed EXACTLY as the same work would be inside a plan: the grant
// outranks the prose (a write-capable Task is "implement"), and an unclassifiable
// task, or one whose role has no pin, returns "" and inherits the parent's model.
//
// OFF UNLESS ASKED FOR. Both the posture and the configured auto-assign default
// must be set; otherwise this returns "" before touching the classifier, so a
// posture-off spawn never reaches resolveTaskModel and stays byte-identical to
// before this existed. The classifier reads the tools the child will actually
// hold (resolvedToolAllowlist), and a resolution error there degrades to "" —
// a routing hint is never worth failing a spawn over.
