// A TASK THE PLAN KILLED MUST NOT BE REPORTED AS A TASK THAT FAILED.
//
// THE MEASURED RUN. Two plan tasks died at 300,017ms and 300,066ms — 49ms apart,
// dispatched together, on a plan with max_tokens 0 and no max_wall_seconds. The
// report said "cancelled: 0, failed: 2", and each carried:
//
//	"Subagent terminated by a signal (signal: killed) — it was killed before it
//	 finished. Common causes: an out-of-memory kill, a timeout, or cancellation;
//	 check the signal to tell which."
//
// A guess list, printed by the component that had made the decision. The reader
// concluded their machine had run out of memory and went to raise sub-agent
// limits that were never involved.
//
// THE MECHANISM. osexec.CommandContext with no WaitDelay SIGKILLs the child when
// its context is cancelled, and Executor.Run returns that as a StatusError
// result with a NIL error. So `concluded := err == nil && !result.Stalled` was
// true for a task the plan had just killed, cutShort was false, and it fell
// through to TaskFailed.
