// Resume: what a plan had already done when the process went away.
//
// This is the READ half of durability. The write half put the five lifecycle
// events in the session log from both surfaces; this reduces them back into
// plan state. ARCHITECTURE.md's rule is the shape of the whole thing — plan
// state is a DETERMINISTIC REDUCTION over the five events, and there is no
// second store to disagree with.
//
// WHAT THE EVENTS DO AND DO NOT CARRY. The payloads are deliberately small: ids,
// counts, durations, terminal status — not prompts. So the log says which tasks
// finished; it cannot say what they were asked to do. That is why resuming is
// built on a SAVED plan: the plan supplies the work, the log supplies the
// progress, and neither has to grow into the other. Putting prompts in the log
// would have multiplied a fifty-task plan's on-disk size to make the log a
// second copy of something already stored better.
//
// A DISPATCH WITHOUT A TERMINAL EVENT IS THE POINT. Dispatch is written before
// the child runs, so a task that was in flight when the process died is
// distinguishable from one that never started — and it is treated as UNFINISHED,
// never as done. Assuming otherwise would silently drop the one task most likely
// to have been interrupted mid-work.

// PlanProgress is the state of one plan, reduced from its events.
type PlanProgress struct {
	// Name is the plan's name from plan_admitted.
	Name string
	// Order is the execution order recorded at admission.
	Order []string
	// Succeeded holds the ids that reached task_completed.
	Succeeded []string
	// Unfinished holds ids that were dispatched and never reached a terminal
	// event — the process went away mid-task.
	Unfinished []string
	// Failed holds ids that reached task_failed, whatever the outcome. A failed
	// task is worth RE-RUNNING: unlike a success it produced no work to keep.
	Failed []string
	// Outputs holds the BOUNDED output each succeeded task recorded, so a
	// resumed dependent can be briefed on what its completed dependency found —
	// see RemainingPlan. Empty for a task that produced nothing, or one recorded
	// before outputs were stored.
	Outputs map[string]string
	// Identities holds the fingerprint each succeeded task recorded when it ran,
	// so RemainingPlan can tell a completed task that is UNCHANGED from one whose
	// prompt, model, tools or dependencies were edited since. Absent for a task
	// recorded before resume became identity-aware — which RemainingPlan treats
	// as "unknown", matching by id alone exactly as it did before.
	Identities map[string]string
	// Complete reports that a plan_completed event was seen, so the plan ended
	// on purpose rather than being cut off.

// same caller — orchestrate_saved asks Done first and then calls RemainingPlan —
// so they must agree by construction. Comparing len(Succeeded) to len(Order)
// instead made agreement depend on Succeeded holding each of Order's ids exactly
// once, and Succeeded is an append of whatever task_completed carried: an id that
// is not in Order, or one recorded twice, made the count reach len(Order) while
// a task that never ran was still in Remaining. That direction is the harmful

// nothing — ParsePlan refuses that, correctly — so a done dependency is dropped
// and its finding folded into the dependent below. A dependency that is NOT done
// (it re-runs) keeps its edge, so the dependent still waits on the fresh result.
