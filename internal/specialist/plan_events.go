// The plan lifecycle's session-event payloads, built in ONE place.
//
// There are two recorders — the headless one in internal/cli and the TUI's —
// and they must produce identical events for the same plan, because resume is a
// deterministic reduction over these events and a reducer cannot be written
// against two shapes. Two builders would drift (invariant 5), and the drift
// would only surface when someone resumed a plan recorded by the other surface.
//
// The payloads are deliberately small and structured — ids, counts, durations,
// terminal status — not whole task outputs. A plan's outputs already reach the
// transcript through the tool result; duplicating them here would multiply a
// large plan's on-disk size for no added recoverability.

// PlanAdmittedEvent is the record of a validated plan, written before its first
// task runs so a crash mid-plan still leaves the shape on disk.
