// child it started. A plan task has no such caller: the plan owns its children's
// lifetimes, TaskResult.SessionID already carries the id structurally, and the
// output is quoted into the report under "result:", pasted into the dependency
// briefing every downstream task reads, and rendered in the plan panel. So the
// line surfaced a raw session id in the middle of a user-facing answer three
// times over, and told every dependent task to treat it as a finding.
