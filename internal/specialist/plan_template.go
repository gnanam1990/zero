// Plan shapes a model can ask for by name instead of composing from scratch.
//
// THE FAILURE THIS REMOVES. The model deciding to run a plan is not the problem
// — system_prompt.go already tells it when to delegate, and a measured run
// spawned a background sub-agent with the words "sub-agent", "spawn" and
// "parallel" appearing nowhere in the prompt. The problem is what happens next:
// it emits plan JSON that admission refuses, and a turn and a model call are
// spent learning a rule. A real run emitted budget.max_tokens_per_task: 5000 and
// was refused for sitting below the floor.
//
// SO THIS IS A GENERATOR, NOT A CLASSIFIER. Nothing here decides WHETHER to
// plan. It only turns "audit this" into a task graph that admission accepts.
//
// DETERMINISTIC, AND THAT IS THE MULTI-PROVIDER ARGUMENT. An LLM generator needs
// reliable structured output, which across this catalogue means JSON mode on
// some providers, forced tool-use on others and prose-with-fences on the rest —
// twenty-one of its entries are OpenAI-compatible gateways whose capabilities
// are whatever the upstream vendor supports that day. A template needs nothing
// from the provider, so it behaves identically on all of them, including a local
// Ollama that reports no capabilities at all.
//
// EVERY TEMPLATE IS RE-VALIDATED THROUGH ParsePlan before it runs. These emit
// the same args a model would; they are not a second admission path.

// PlanTemplate is one named shape.
