// DISCOVERY READS /v1/models, WHICH IS AN ADVERTISEMENT. It reports what a
// provider is willing to name, not what it will actually run, and the gap
// between those is where this feature has repeatedly fallen in:
//
//   - grok-4.20-multi-agent-0309 lists like any other model and answers
//     "Multi Agent requests are not allowed on chat completions". Six tasks were
//     assigned it; all six died.
//   - A model list fetched for one provider while the session had switched to
//     another lists perfectly and serves nothing.
//   - grok-build-0.1 and grok-imagine-video-1.5 list, price high enough to win
//     the strong tier, and fail every task they touch.
//
// The user's answer so far has been a hand-maintained exclude list — three
// entries, each added after a plan died on it. A probe replaces that with
// evidence: one trivial request per candidate, once, and a model that will not
// answer it is not offered to the router.

// ModelProbeVerdict is what a single probe learned.
