// Where a plan's tasks RUN, when they may write.
//
// STEP 2 OF THREE. Step 1 gave the approval prompt something to show; this
// gives a write-capable plan somewhere to write that is not the user's tree;
// step 3 allows write tools with both as preconditions. Nothing requires
// isolation today, and that is not an oversight — RequiresIsolation is DERIVED
// from the plan's own tools, so it is false while validation rejects write
// tools and becomes true the moment step 3 stops rejecting them. The
// requirement arrives with the capability rather than depending on someone
// remembering to set a flag.
//
// PER PLAN, NOT PER TASK, and the choice matters. Per-task isolation is more
// isolation and less use: this phase executes sequentially and a later task
// routinely needs an earlier one's output, so per-task worktrees would either
// hide that or need a merge step nobody wrote. A plan is the unit of work a
// user reviews, so a plan is the unit that gets a tree — one branch, one diff.
//
// FAIL CLOSED. A plan that requires isolation and cannot get it is REFUSED,
// never run in the parent tree with a warning. The whole point of the
// precondition is that it is one.

// PlanWorkspace is the directory a plan's tasks run in.
