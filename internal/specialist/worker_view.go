// What this session has set going, and what it cost.
//
// A VIEW, NOT A STORE, and that is not a stylistic preference. ARCHITECTURE.md
// scopes the "no new store" rule to exactly this kind of state, and the reason
// is that two records of one fact eventually disagree — a registry file would
// have to be written on every dispatch, kept correct across crashes, resumes and
// background completions, and reconciled with the event log that already knows.
// Everything below is a fold over events that are ALREADY WRITTEN by
// accounting.go; nothing new is recorded, so there is nothing new to keep true.
//
// WHY IT IS WORTH HAVING. A session that has spawned Task children, plan tasks
// and background plans has no single answer to "what did this session start, and
// what did it cost". A measured run spawned one background child and the only
// way to learn its fate was to read events.jsonl by hand.
//
// MULTI-PROVIDER RULE: tokens are the one number EVERY provider reports, and
// cost is not — most of this catalogue's gateways report no rates at all. So
// this reports tokens always and says plainly how many workers it could not
// price, rather than presenting a total that silently omits them.

// WorkerKind distinguishes what started a child.
