// Package measurements keeps a run's own timings so a report cannot invent them.
//
// THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR. A measured run finished a benchmark and reported
// a table of test timings that no command in the session had produced. The same
// test read 0.86s in one paste and 4.20s in the next with nothing said about the
// difference, a -race overhead moved from +3.7% to +133% between two tellings of
// the same result, and the column summed to an exact total no real transcript
// lands on. A prompt rule — "re-run every command before you paste it" — is the
// obvious answer and the weak one: a model that is willing to write numbers it
// did not measure is equally willing to say it re-ran them.
//
// The harness is not. Every command's output passed through this process and was
// written to the session log, so the run's real numbers are already here. This
// package reads them back and compares them against what the answer claims,
// which is the one check a model cannot satisfy by asserting harder.
//
// DELIBERATELY LOOSE. Timings vary between runs for honest reasons — a loaded
// machine, a warm cache, a different -count. The tolerance below is a 50% band,
// which lets ordinary variation through and catches 0.86s reported as 4.20s. The
// cost of a false positive is high (a tripwire that cries wolf is turned off, and
// then it catches nothing), and the cost of a false negative is one uncaught
// number, so this errs firmly toward silence.
