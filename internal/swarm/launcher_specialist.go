// NewSpecialistLauncher adapts internal/specialist.Executor into a
// MemberLauncher: each swarm member runs as a specialist sub-agent. This is the
// production "direct" launch path (used when no daemon pool is wired). The
// member inherits the orchestrator's model via spec.Model and runs in spec.Cwd,
// so it stays under the same sandbox + policy as its parent — the swarm never
// grants a member more authority.
//
// agentType maps to the specialist agent name; the specialist's own definition
// for that name governs the member's system prompt and tools. RunInBackground is
// deliberately left false: the swarm provides concurrency itself (one goroutine
// per member), so each Run executes to completion inside its goroutine.
//
// spec.PermissionMode (resolved + clamped by buildSpec, never above the
// orchestrator's) is propagated so the child only runs unsafe/high autonomy when
// the orchestrator is itself unsafe; otherwise it runs non-unsafe. An empty mode
// is substituted with the non-unsafe "auto" default so a swarm member can never
// fall into the historical empty-means-high path — that is the Task tool's
// behavior, not the swarm's.

		// on to be RENDERED — swarm_collect writes `result: <text>` and collapse
		// only flattens newlines and truncates, so the id reaches the user
		// verbatim. The Task path escapes the same leak only because the TUI
		// drops its raw result row entirely (toolCardSuppressedInTranscript is
		// "Task" or "update_plan"); swarm_collect has no such suppression, so it
		// has to be stripped at the source instead.
