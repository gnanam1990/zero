// The background-plan launcher: who owns a background plan's LIFETIME.
//
// The tool does not, and that is the whole point of the seam. A background plan
// must outlive the tool call that started it and must NOT outlive the session,
// and the only thing that knows where the session ends is the surface that runs
// it. So the surface supplies a launcher, keeps the context, and drains on exit;
// the tool asks to be run and is told yes or no.
//
// It also makes headless exec's refusal fall out rather than be special-cased:
// that process exits when the turn ends, so it supplies no launcher at all, and
// a background plan there is refused with a reason instead of being started and
// orphaned.
//
// ONE AT A TIME, deliberately. The panel is keyed by task id and the bridge
// holds one plan's cancel; two concurrent background plans would report into
// one panel and the second would overwrite the first's rows. Refusing the
// second is a stated rule; letting the UI silently pick one is a defect.

// planLauncher runs background plans under a session-scoped context.
