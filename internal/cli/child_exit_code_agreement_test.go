// internal/specialist decides whether to retry a task from the child's exit
// code — a structural signal rather than its prose. It cannot import this
// package to read exitIncomplete, because cli imports specialist and the
// dependency cannot run both ways, so the constant is duplicated there.
//
// If this file's exitIncomplete ever moves and specialist's copy does not, a
// declined task stops being recognised as declined and silently loses its one
// retry — with nothing failing anywhere. That is the exact shape of defect this
// session has produced repeatedly: a value that exists at one layer, is consumed
// at another, and quietly stops agreeing.
