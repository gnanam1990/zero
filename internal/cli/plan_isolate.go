// The isolator: a git worktree for a plan that may write.
//
// It reuses internal/worktrees, the same package `zero exec --worktree` already
// uses, rather than shelling out to git again. That matters beyond tidiness —
// worktrees.Prepare already handles name validation, the base directory, repo
// discovery from a subdirectory, and the difference between a checkout and a
// worktree. A second implementation would eventually disagree with the first
// about which of those a plan gets.
//
// NOT DELETED ON RELEASE. A plan that wrote something produced work the user has
// not seen yet, and removing the tree would remove the only copy of it. Release
// exists for the case where a plan is refused after the tree was prepared; the
// tree a plan actually wrote in stays, and its path is reported so it can be
// reviewed, merged, or thrown away deliberately.

// planWorktreeName derives a worktree name from a plan name.
//
// worktrees.Prepare enforces its own allow-list on the result, so this only has
// to produce a candidate; anything it cannot clean is handed over as a prefix
// and Prepare supplies the rest. Deliberately NOT a sanitiser that promises
// safety — the guarantee lives in one place, where it is tested.
