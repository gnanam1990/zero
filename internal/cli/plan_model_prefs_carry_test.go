// EVERY CONFIGURED PREFERENCE MUST SURVIVE THE TRANSLATION, and this is checked
// by reflection rather than field by field on purpose.
//
// planModelPreferences is a hand-written copy between two structs that are
// deliberately kept apart, so specialist need not import config. Hand-written
// copies rot silently: a field gets added to both sides and to nothing in the
// middle, and the symptom is a setting the user wrote in their config having no
// effect — with nothing logged, nothing failing, and no way to tell it from the
// feature simply not working. RouterGuidance was added this way; the next one
// will be too.
//
// Naming the fields here would only pin today's set. Walking them means a new
// field is caught the moment it exists.
