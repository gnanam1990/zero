// planSessionRecorder bridges plan lifecycle events onto the existing exec
// session recorder.
//
// IT PRESERVES THE BEST-EFFORT CONTRACT EXACTLY. execSessionRecorder.append
// returns nothing, latches its first error, and short-circuits every later
// call; warnIfRecordingFailed surfaces that once at run end. This type adds no
// error path of its own: every method returns nothing, so there is no way for a
// recording failure to reach ExecutePlan, and therefore no way for it to abort
// a plan mid-flight. A nil recorder is a no-op rather than a panic, for the
// same reason.
//
// The payloads are deliberately small and structured — ids, counts, durations,
// the terminal status and max_speedup — not whole task outputs. A plan's task
// outputs already reach the transcript through the tool result; duplicating
// them into the event log would multiply a large plan's on-disk size for no
// added recoverability.
