// The zeromaxing plan-size tiers.
//
// A plan's task count was bounded by ONE hard-coded number with no way to move
// it: a twenty-task ceiling that a user with a genuinely large sweep could not
// raise and a user on a metered provider could not lower. The tier is the knob,
// and it is NAMED rather than numeric so the config file says what it means and
// so "no ceiling at all" is expressible without a sentinel integer.
//
// IT REMAINS A HARD CAP, not an advisory warning. The reference implementation
// warns and proceeds; here a plan over the tier is REJECTED, because under this
// posture every plan task is a child inheriting a 320-turn ceiling — fifty tasks
// authorise 16,000 child turns from one tool call. A warning the model emits to
// itself is not a bound on that. The rejection names the tier and the setting,
// so the ceiling is discoverable at the moment it is hit rather than being a
// number the user has to find in the source.
